## Issue faced

- **i find it difficult to write valina js because i use react js right from time.**
  \
- **according to the first instruction i read, we were told to use any framework of our choice, so i have been implementing it with Reactjs before another instruction was sent to us about using pure html,css and js. so i just had to started all over from scratch**
